            <h3>Simplicity is the best policy for me</h3>
            <p>Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple,
                in
                contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or
                complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply
                beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative
                to
                what is required</p>
